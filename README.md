# # Prework Study Guide for Eveyone

## Description

The reason I started this was because I wanted to change myself and learn something i have always been interested in and this project will help guide me to the right process. The project gave me chance to think and breakdown the issue i came accross piece by piece in order resolve issues. The project has taught at least some basic know how of HTML CSS and Java as well as to how to work with the command line and github.

## Usage

The way the Study Guide can be used lies in the fact that it contains files for each of the three main de languages we will be going over. It has an HTML section, a CSS section and a Javascript section. Each area give information about each of the languages. It will have some basic start up information as well as some definition for some of the element that would be used in the code. As well as some instruction for Git.
